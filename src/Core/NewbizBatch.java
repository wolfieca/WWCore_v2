/**
 * A single batch of new business. Contrary to the Wizard implementation, the
 * WolffeWare NewbizBatch is built as a parallel structure to normal newbiz. That
 * is, there are Debtor, Debt, Demographic, etc tables in the database and any
 * given entry in a NewbizBatch can be treated as a normal Debtor for the most
 * part (the biggest exception is the lack of a local account number, and the lack
 * of an independent message queue for the newbiz debtors, though the batch does
 * have a message queue).
