/**
 * A RemoteUser refers to a user that is allowed limited
 * access to the Company's system. Typically, this will be a user working for a
 * Client, who has access to certain reports, and can upload/enter new business
 * to the Company for processing. A remote user generally cannot be messaged 
 * using the normal messaging mechanisms, so there is often a need for an
 * interface to an external system to communicate with them. This can also
 * represent users who are Debtors and Vendors. Normal users who are logging in
 * from untrusted networks have their access limited until the security of their
 * location has been attested to.
